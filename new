Here’s a detailed guide on how you can use Microsoft 365 Copilot in Researcher mode (and adjacent capabilities) to craft a compelling presentation to your firm of ~800 people—across HR, Legal, IT, Finance, Research & Investment. I’ll assume you already have access/licensing for the Researcher/Analyst agents (if not, I’ll include how to check). Then I’ll walk you through a step-by-step workflow plus best practices tailored for your audience mix.

✅ What is “Researcher mode” (aka the Researcher agent)
	•	Microsoft describes the Researcher agent in Copilot as a specialist reasoning assistant: it “can analyse vast amounts of information with secure, compliant access to your work data — your emails, meetings, files, chats, and more — and the web” to deliver high-quality, multi-step research outputs.  ￼
	•	It uses a planning + iterative retrieval + synthesis workflow:
	•	Planning phase: Clarifies the user’s intent and breaks the task into subtasks.  ￼
	•	Iterative research phase: Repeated cycles of reason → retrieve → review, until marginal new insight is low.  ￼
	•	Synthesis phase: Produce structured output (e.g., a report) with citations and context.  ￼
	•	It’s different (and more powerful for “deep research”) than the standard Copilot chat mode: more rigorous, multi-step, draws on enterprise + web data.  ￼
	•	Availability: As of June 2025 the Researcher and Analyst agents are generally available to users with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license; usage is limited (e.g., 25 combined queries/month) in some cases.  ￼

🛠 Workflow for your presentation: how you can apply Researcher mode

Since you’re addressing a broad firm (HR, Legal, IT, Finance, Research/Investment), your talk likely needs to be structured, inclusive, and framed in a way that resonates across disciplines. Here’s a workflow you can follow, leveraging Copilot’s Researcher agent:

1. Define the objective and scope

Start by clarifying what you want your audience to take away. Example: “I want people in HR, Legal, IT, Finance, Research/Investment to understand how we are leveraging data & AI in our firm’s operations, the risks & controls we’re putting in place, and the key opportunities we see ahead.”
Use the Researcher agent to ask:

“I’m preparing a firm-wide presentation for ~800 people across departments (HR, Legal, IT, Finance, Research/Investment). I need a 30-minute slide deck plus 5 minutes Q&A on how our firm is using data & AI responsibly. Please clarify what key topic areas I should include, given the cross-department audience, and propose a high-level slide outline.”
Let it ask you clarifying questions if needed (it can).

2. Gather content and insights

Once you have the outline, for each section ask the Researcher to gather relevant internal + external content. For example:
	•	For HR: “What are the latest trends in AI in HR (talent acquisition, retention, bias mitigation) and what internal data/initiatives do we have?”
	•	For Legal: “What are the key compliance/regulatory risks of AI adoption (in the US and globally) that our firm should consider?”
	•	For Finance/Investment: “What are the emerging investment themes around data/AI in our sector and what some benchmark firms are doing?”
	•	For IT: “What foundational architecture, data governance, security controls are critical for AI deployment in the enterprise?”

In each case you can ask the Researcher agent to pull from your internal documents (if accessible) + credible external sources + produce key insights, risks, case examples, and recommended actions.

3. Synthesize into slide content

Have Researcher produce draft text for each slide (or slide notes), summary bullet‐points, citations, and speaker-talking‐points. For example:

“Generate text for Slide 3: ‘AI in HR – Opportunity & Risks’. Include 3 opportunity bullets, 2 risk bullets, and a short speaker note paragraph. Provide source references for each bullet.”

It can also help create a consistent tone and format across slides.

4. Tailor for your mixed audience

Because your audience spans multiple departments, you want some common themes + department-specific takeaways. Use Researcher to craft:
	•	A shared introduction: Why this matters to the whole firm (strategy, culture, risk).
	•	Department-specific implications: one mini slide or note for each department: “What HR needs to know”, “What Legal needs to know”, etc.
	•	Universal call to action: e.g., “What each of you can do in your role” or “How we’ll collaborate across functions”.

5. Prepare for Q&A

Ask Researcher to generate likely questions from each department and suggested responses. For example: HR might ask about bias mitigation; Legal might ask about liability; IT about data privacy; Finance about ROI/tracking. Having these prepared will help you with confidence.

6. Final review & polish

Use Researcher to review the deck:
	•	“Check: Are any statements not backed by sources? Flag any speculative wording.”
	•	“Provide alternative wording for Slide 7 to make it more engaging/persuasive for non-technical staff.”
	•	“Check that jargon is minimal and that each slide has one clear takeaway.”

7. Delivery tips

While Copilot won’t deliver the talk, you can ask it for presenter coaching:
	•	“Suggest 3 ways to open the presentation that instantly engage a broad audience (HR to Finance).”
	•	“Provide a short story or anecdote relevant to AI adoption in professional services firms.”
	•	“Recommend a closing slide that invites cross-department collaboration and next steps.”

🎤 Presentation structure suggestion

Here’s a suggested structure (which you can refine using Researcher):
	1.	Opening Slide – Title, subtitle: e.g., “Data & AI: Transforming How We Work Together”.
	2.	Why it matters – Big picture for the firm: competitive edge, risk, responsibility.
	3.	What’s happening externally – Trends across industries (HR, Legal, IT, Finance, Research).
	4.	Our current state – Where we are now: projects, data/infrastructure maturity, successes.
	5.	Opportunities by function – Breakout: HR, Legal, IT, Finance, Research/Investment.
	6.	Risks, controls and governance – Data privacy, bias, compliance, security.
	7.	How we’ll do it – Operating model: cross-functional teams, governance, roadmap.
	8.	What this means for you – Specific takeaways by department; how each person contributes.
	9.	Next steps & call to action – What you expect from audience; how to engage.
	10.	Q&A – Invite questions.
	11.	Closing – Recap and inspirational moment: “Together we’ll…”

Researcher can help you fill content for each of these.

🔍 Best practices & tips
	•	Be explicit with your prompts: The more context you provide (audience, slide format, tone, what you already know), the better Researcher will perform.
	•	Check citations: Researcher will provide sources, but you should spot check them — ensure they’re credible and relevant to your firm’s context.
	•	Use internal data: If you have internal documents, dashboards, reports, feed them (or reference them) so Researcher includes those.
	•	Simplify for non-technical audience: Avoid heavy AI jargon; focus on what it means for each role.
	•	Balance Opportunity + Risk: Especially with senior/legal/finance audience, you’ll want to emphasize governance as much as opportunity.
	•	Visuals count: Ask Researcher for suggestions on visuals/infographics for each slide (e.g., timeline, matrix of function vs. impact, risk heat map).
	•	Engagement: Given the large audience (800 people), consider interactive elements (polls, live Q&A) and slide decks that speak to cross-functional relevance.
	•	Rehearse: Use Researcher to help script key talking points and transitions between slides, especially when shifting from one department’s part to another.
	•	Governance & data ethics: For a broad audience, include a slide on how the firm is managing data ethics, bias, privacy and how each function plays a part. Researcher can give you up-to-date frameworks and examples.
	•	Time-management: Keep each section tight; large audiences have variable backgrounds—clear, concise, high-level insights work best, with an optional deeper appendix for those who want detail.

If you like, I can generate a draft slide deck outline + suggested slide content (in PowerPoint format) using Researcher mode as a base, tailored to your firm’s departments and audience size. Would you like me to build that?
