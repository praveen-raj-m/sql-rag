## **Flow Rationale**

1. **Start broad and inclusive** (intro + what Copilot is).
2. **Show the ecosystem** (connected apps).
3. **Balance optimism with caution** (risks).
4. **Teach how to use it effectively** (prompts & advanced prompting).
5. **Dive into tools people use daily** (Outlook, Word, PowerPoint, Teams).
6. **Show future-facing features** (365 Agents, researcher/analyst).
7. **Make it personal** (customization & departmental use cases).
8. **Wrap with vision + resources** (conclusion).

---

👉 You’re not missing much — but adding **“Use Cases by Department”** makes it resonate with your 800-person diverse audience. It grounds the talk in **their workday reality** instead of just abstract features.

Would you like me to **draft a one-liner tagline/example for each department (Finance, HR, Legal, Investment, IT, Research)** so you can plug them directly into the *“Copilot in Your Field”* slide?
Here’s a clean **introductory slide draft** you can use at the start of your presentation:

👉 This sets the tone: **one slide with “Copilot at the center, all apps around it”** (visual idea: a hub-and-spoke diagram, Copilot in the middle, Word/Excel/PowerPoint/Outlook/Teams/etc. around it).

Do you want me to **design the hub-and-spoke style slide text layout** so you can drop it into PowerPoint directly?
Here are 8 key **risks of using Copilot-style tools in the workplace** that you can put into your presentation slide. These are broad, cross-departmental risks that a firm of 800 people can relate to:

---

Got it — since your firm already secures data and compliance, you want **everyday practical risks in workday use**, not security/legal ones. Here’s a refined list you can use directly on a slide:

---

### **Risks of Using Copilot & AI Tools in Daily Work**

1. **Hallucinations (Made-Up Facts)**

   * AI can confidently generate wrong or fabricated information.

2. **Inaccuracy in Numbers & Details**

   * Risk of incorrect data in reports, analysis, or financial summaries.

3. **Generic or Low-Quality Output**

   * Drafts may lack depth, originality, or professional tone.

4. **Over-Reliance on AI**

   * Users may accept answers without cross-checking or critical thinking.

5. **Context Misunderstanding**

   * AI may misinterpret business jargon, acronyms, or company-specific terms.

6. **Bias in Suggestions**

   * Generated content might unintentionally favor certain views or language styles.

7. **Version/Source Mismatch**

   * AI might provide outdated references, policies, or industry information.

8. **Skill Atrophy**

   * Heavy dependence on AI could reduce employees’ own problem-solving and writing skills.

---

👉 These are **practical risks in daily workflows** (finance, HR, legal, research, IT, etc.), without touching data privacy/compliance.

Do you want me to also **make each one a short, catchy phrase (like “Hallucinations,” “Outdated Info,” “Over-Reliance”)** so they fit neatly into a single slide with icons?


---

Would you like me to **format these into a clean one-slide visual** (with short punchy bullets and maybe icons for each risk), or do you prefer just the text for now?
