Copy/paste into slides as needed.

# 1) Zero-Shot Prompting

**Definition:** Ask for an outcome with no examples; rely on clear instructions, scope, and constraints.

**Finance:**
“Analyze the impact of a **+1% interest-rate increase** on our fixed-income portfolio (duration ~5.2, convexity ~0.18). If issuer-level data is missing, assume investment-grade, average spread +10 bps. Provide: (1) price impact estimate, (2) sectors most exposed, (3) 3 mitigation options.”

**Sales:**
“Draft a **2-paragraph value proposition** for our cloud analytics platform for mid-market retailers. Assume $50–$200M revenue, 10–15 store locations, legacy POS. Include 2 quantified benefits and 1 short customer quote (fabricated but realistic).”

**IT:**
“Propose a **rolling 30-day patch window** for Windows servers in prod/dev. Include risk tiers, CAB touchpoints, rollback steps, and KPI targets (patch latency, failure rate).”
