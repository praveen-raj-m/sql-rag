Ah — thank you! That **gap between `<ol>` and `<p>`** is a common HTML rendering behavior, especially when the markdown has:

```md
1. First item

Some paragraph text here.
```

This renders to:

```html
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
</ol>
<p>Some paragraph text here.</p>
```

And browsers often apply **default margin** to both `<ol>` and `<p>`, causing visible vertical spacing.

### ✅ Fix It with SCSS (Recommended)

Update your `.markdown-output` style to normalize spacing:

```scss
.markdown-output {
  ol, ul {
    margin-top: 0.5rem;
    margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
    padding-left: 1.25rem;
  }

  p {
    margin-top: 0.25rem;
    margin-bottom: 0.25rem;
  }

  li {
    margin-bottom: 0.25rem;
  }
}
```

> This reduces the spacing between lists and paragraphs and keeps things tight and readable.

### ✅ Bonus: Remove Top/Bottom Margin from First/Last Child (Optional)

If you're rendering a block of markdown, also consider:

```scss
.markdown-output > *:first-child {
  margin-top: 0;
}

.markdown-output > *:last-child {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
```

Let me know if you're seeing any unwanted space **within the list items themselves** or need a more compact layout!
