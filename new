Here’s a structured way you can present Copilot Analyst Agent to a firm-wide audience of ~800 people, covering HR, Legal, Finance, Research, IT, and Investment teams. This format works both for a live talk and slides.

⸻

1. What is Copilot Analyst Agent?
	•	A digital AI assistant built into Microsoft Copilot that helps employees analyze, summarize, and present information.
	•	Works across emails, documents, spreadsheets, Teams chats, PDFs, and external data sources.
	•	Think of it as a research analyst + assistant that works across departments — turning raw data into actionable insights.

⸻

2. What Can It Do? (General Capabilities)
	•	Data Analysis & Insights: Analyze financial models, survey results, contracts, or HR data in seconds.
	•	Summarization: Turn 200-page legal docs, research papers, or compliance reports into 2-page summaries.
	•	Scenario Testing: “What if” analysis on budgets, headcount, or investment returns.
	•	Presentation Support: Auto-generate charts, talking points, or Q&A prep for executives.
	•	Knowledge Search: Pull answers from across SharePoint, Teams, and OneDrive — no manual digging.
	•	Custom Prompts: Departments can tailor prompts for recurring needs (e.g., HR attrition reports, Legal compliance briefs).

3. Department-Specific Use Cases

	•	Extract trends from spreadsheets (cashflow, risk exposure).
	•	Prepare board-ready summaries with visuals.

Research & Investment
	•	Summarize market intelligence, analyst reports, or academic papers.
	•	Compare investment strategies (allocation effects, risk-return tradeoffs).
	•	Quickly pull competitor updates from filings and market data.
	•	Generate scenario models (interest rate hikes, currency risk).

4. Why It Matters
	•	Scales productivity: Saves hours of manual reading, analysis, and reporting.
	•	Improves accuracy: Reduces human oversight in data-heavy tasks.
	•	Levels the playing field: Every employee gets a “junior analyst” to support them.
	•	Future-ready: Positions the firm to adapt faster in finance, legal, and tech landscapes.

5. Example Scenarios (Show Live if Possible)
	•	HR Prompt: “Summarize last quarter’s attrition report and suggest top 3 talking points for the executive meeting.”
	•	Finance Prompt: “Compare Q2 and Q3 expenses, highlight unusual variances, and generate a chart for my slides.”
	•	Legal Prompt: “Summarize this 80-page compliance regulation and list key risks for our firm.”
	•	Investment Prompt: “Generate a risk-return profile comparison between our portfolio and the S&P500 over the last 12 months.”

6. Best Practices for All Employees
	•	Be Specific in Prompts: Tell Copilot the format you want (table, chart, bullet points).
	•	Use Context: Reference the dataset, doc, or chat thread you want analyzed.
	•	Validate Outputs: Treat Copilot as an analyst — always review before finalizing.
	•	Collaborate with It: Use it to brainstorm, draft, and polish — not as a black box.

✅ By the end of the presentation, everyone should see Copilot Analyst Agent as a firm-wide multiplier: faster reporting for Finance, better compliance checks for Legal, smarter hiring insights for HR, sharper investment decisions for Research, and smoother operations for IT.

Would you like me to draft a slide-by-slide outline (with titles + 3–4 bullet points each) so you can directly use it for your 800-person firm presentation?


Got it 👍 — you want ready-to-use, detailed prompts that show how Copilot Analyst Agent can pull insights from the internet (not just local files). These prompts are designed for different departments, so you can demonstrate how each team can use Copilot as a “junior analyst + researcher.”

	4.	Sources → Ask for source links to verify.
