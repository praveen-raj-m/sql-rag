### Illustrative Enterprise Monthly Cost Estimate

**Example Usage (30-day month):**

* Storage: 50 GB
* Reads: 100 M
* Writes: 50 M

| Platform     | Est. Monthly Cost                                                                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pinecone** | Storage \$16.5 + Writes \$300 + Reads \$2400 = \$2716.5 → Billed \$2716.50 (≥ \$500 minimum)    |
| **Weaviate** | Assume 10 AIUs: 10 × 24h × 30 × \$2.64 = \$1900                                                 |
| **Astra DB** | Storage \$12.5 + Writes \$31 + Reads \$37 = \$80.5 → Billed likely ≥ custom enterprise contract |

### Choosing Guide

* **High volume ops, enterprise security & SLA** ➝ **Pinecone** or **Weaviate**, depending on AIU consumption vs explicit unit pricing
* **Fine-grained vector-element access costs** ➝ **Astra** (especially with vector operations charges)
* **Preference for managed Cassandra + vector hybrid** ➝ **Astra**
* **Need dedicated infrastructure within your tenancy** ➝ All three support BYOC; Pinecone and Weaviate offer stronger package deals for isolation
