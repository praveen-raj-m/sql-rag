Here’s a detailed outline you can use for a firm-wide presentation (800 people from HR, Legal, IT, Finance, Research, Investment etc) on Microsoft 365 Copilot, and specifically its new features Copilot Pages and Copilot Notebooks. I’ll include what they are, what they can do, and then how each department can use them. You can adapt this into a slide deck, but this gives you the content and talking points.

1. What is Microsoft 365 Copilot?

Definition & context:
	•	Microsoft 365 Copilot is Microsoft’s AI-powered assistant embedded in the Microsoft 365 ecosystem (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams etc).  ￼
	•	It uses context (your documents, email, calendar, chats) and generative AI to help you create, summarise, analyse, automate, collaborate.  ￼
	•	It is part of the broader move to embed AI into everyday business productivity.  ￼

Key capabilities (high-level):
	•	Generate content: e.g., draft reports, emails, presentations.
	•	Summarise large volumes of information: e.g., meeting transcripts, document libraries.
	•	Analyse data: e.g., in Excel — trends, insights, formatting suggestions.
	•	Collaborate and iterate: helping you refine ideas, giving suggestions, working in real-time.
	•	Context-aware: works with content you already have (files, chats, links). The newer Notebook/Pages features build on this.

Why it matters for a firm of this size:
	•	With ~800 people across multiple functions, productivity, standardisation, knowledge sharing and reducing manual tedious tasks are big wins.
	•	The AI assistant allows staff to spend less time on repetitive tasks (formatting, summarising) and more time on value-added work (analysis, decision-making, strategy).
	•	It supports better collaboration across functions — reducing siloes and enabling more consistent insights.

2. What are Copilot Pages and Notebooks?

Copilot Pages
	•	Copilot Pages is described as “an interactive canvas within Microsoft 365 Copilot that lets you turn Copilot responses into editable, shareable pages.”  ￼
	•	The idea: you prompt Copilot, get a response, then click the Pages icon to convert that response into a page you can edit – add text, tables, links, images, etc.  ￼
	•	It is collaborative: you can share those pages with your team via Teams/Outlook etc, and multiple people can work on them together.  ￼
	•	It is persistent: these pages are saved in your Microsoft 365 storage (SharePoint / OneDrive).  ￼

What makes Pages distinct:
	•	It acts like a document, but AI-enabled and collaborative from inception (AI + human).
	•	Instead of just chat with Copilot and getting a one-off answer, you can build a structured document around it, refine, share, iterate.
	•	Good for projects, group work, presenting results, shared deliverables.

Copilot Notebooks
	•	Notebooks are described as “your AI-powered workspace for focused tasks. Gather chats, files, links, and more ­and get tailored answers grounded in your content.”  ￼
	•	They allow you to pull together a wide range of content (notes, docs, meeting recordings, websites) and the Notebook (and Copilot) continually scan/ingest the content so the AI is grounded in your context.  ￼
	•	One interesting feature: Notebooks can even create an audio overview of content with two hosts that walk you through key points.  ￼

What makes Notebooks distinct:
	•	It’s more like a “workspace” for a project or domain: you collect many source artifacts and then ask Copilot to analyse, synthesise, assist.
	•	It supports ongoing, evolving content rather than a single output.
	•	Very useful for complex tasks (e.g., research, compliance, knowledge management) where you have many documents and you need AI-help to make sense of them.

3. What can Copilot Pages & Notebooks more broadly do – practical capabilities

Here are some specific capabilities (you can show screenshots in your slides) and their significance:
	•	Turn a prompt like “Create a table with 4 columns labelled Name, Assignment, Status, Estimated Completion Date. Add 6 rows of data” and Copilot generates it; then convert into a Page and refine.  ￼
	•	In Notebooks: ingest meeting recordings, documents, link websites and then ask “What are the key risks mentioned in this set of documents?” and get a grounded answer.  ￼
	•	Share Pages with the team, collaborate in real time — reducing email attachment chaos and versioning issues.
	•	Store your Pages/Notebooks in your organisation’s storage (SharePoint/OneDrive) with governance and lifecycle.  ￼
	•	Use the AI to create audio summaries (Notebooks) which can help busy executives consume content faster.
	•	Use the AI to generate drafts (reports/meeting minutes), perform data transformations (Excel) and support decision-making: offering insights, highlighting trends, summarising. (This general Copilot capability applies).

Key benefits for the organisation:
	•	Efficiency gains: Less time spent on the “grunt work” of summarising, formatting, gathering info.
	•	Better collaboration: Shared canvases reduce siloes.
	•	Knowledge capture: With Notebooks you can centralise project knowledge, past work, meeting recordings — making future reuse easier.
	•	Consistency & scaling: The same tool across HR, Legal, IT, Finance etc helps scale AI-augmented productivity firm-wide.
	•	Competitive advantage: Firms that use AI-enabled tools effectively will be able to respond faster, make better decisions, and free staff for higher-value work.

Limitations / considerations (good to mention for realistic expectations):
	•	The AI is only as good as the input/context. For Notebooks, you need quality source content.
	•	Privacy/permissions/governance: content is stored in user containers and has limits (storage quota, lifecycle).  ￼
	•	Training and adoption required — people will need to learn how best to prompt, how to structure Notebooks/Pages, how to collaborate.
	•	Manage expectations: Not a magic replacement for domain expertise; rather an assistant.
	•	Usage/licensing: Some features may require the paid Copilot license, or specific enterprise plan. (Check internal Microsoft licensing).

4. Department-wise use cases

Here’s how each department (HR, Legal, IT, Finance, Research, Investment) can leverage Copilot Pages/Notebooks + Copilot in general. You can adapt these for your firm’s specific workflows.

HR
	•	Create Pages for onboarding workflows: e.g., Copilot generates first draft of the onboarding checklist, responsibilities, schedule. Then HR team refines in a shared Page.
	•	Use Notebooks to gather all hiring documentation, candidate assessments, interview notes, training materials — then ask the Notebook: “What skills gaps did we identify across candidates for this role?”
	•	Use Copilot to summarise employee feedback surveys or exit interview transcripts (ingest into Notebook) and produce insights.
	•	Use Pages for policy updates: draft new policy wording, share with stakeholders for review, collaborate.
	•	Use audio overviews for leadership teams to catch up quickly on HR project status.

Legal / Compliance
	•	Use Notebooks to collect all documents related to a regulation (e.g., new data protection law), case files, internal policies, memos. Then ask: “What sections of our policy are impacted, what actions must we take by date X?”
	•	Use Pages to draft standard contract templates; let Copilot generate baseline language, then legal team reviews/refines in the shared Page.
	•	Use Copilot in Word to summarise long contracts, highlight clauses that deviate from standard terms.
	•	Use collaborative Pages across legal and business teams to track risk-register items, actions, status columns (table).
	•	Use audio summary for busy executives or board members of legal updates.

IT / Operations
	•	Use Notebooks to capture project docs, infrastructure diagrams, run‐books, incident reports. Then ask: “What recurring incidents are emerging from these logs?”
	•	Use Pages to draft rollout plans for new systems, including timeline, milestones, resources; share with stakeholders.
	•	Use Copilot to generate initial drafts of technical documentation or user guides.
	•	Use Pages/Notebooks to centralise knowledge (FAQs, troubleshooting steps) for team onboarding and reference.
	•	Use automation prompts: ask Copilot to summarise tickets, identify patterns, suggest next‐steps.

Finance
	•	Use Notebooks to ingest financial reports, Excel models, email threads on budgets. Then ask: “What are the top three cost drivers this quarter vs last quarter?”
	•	Use Pages to generate board-level summary decks: Copilot drafts the narrative, key charts from Excel, then finance team refines.
	•	Use Copilot in Excel to generate pivot tables, perform what-if analyses: e.g., “Show me budget variance for each department and highlight >10% deviations.” (General Copilot capability)
	•	Use Pages for annual planning: table of assumptions, milestones, financial forecasts — share with business partners.
	•	Use audio summaries of financial highlights for non-finance stakeholders.

Research / Analytics
	•	Use Notebooks to gather research papers, internal studies, market-data, competitor analysis, meeting notes. Then ask: “What are emerging themes/trends across these sources? Provide summary and implications.”
	•	Use Pages to collaborate on research reports: initial draft from Copilot, then analysts refine, add charts, cite sources.
	•	Use Copilot to generate visualizations in Excel or suggest data transformations.
	•	Use Notebooks for knowledge management: all past studies, insights, annotated by the team — enabling future reuse and avoiding reinventing the wheel.

Investment / Portfolio Management
	•	Use Notebooks to pull together investment memos, due diligence docs, market outlooks, meeting transcripts with management teams. Ask: “Summarise key risks/opportunities for Investment X based on these documents.”
	•	Use Pages to build the investment committee deck: narrative, charts, table of assumptions, next-steps — AI drafts then team refines.
	•	Use Copilot in Excel for scenario modelling: e.g., “Show impact on IRR if growth is 5% less each year for 3 years.”
	•	Use collaborative Pages for tracking portfolio performance: table of assets, status, commentary; shared with investment and finance teams.
	•	Use audio overview to quickly brief senior executives pre-meeting.

6. Some additional tips for the firm-wide presentation
	•	Use real-life examples or tailored-to-our-firm scenarios (e.g., for your Investment team, use one of your actual assets as the example) to make it concrete.
	•	Include a live demo or short video snippet of Pages/Notebooks (if feasible) to show “this is how easy it is.”
	•	Encourage participation: ask “Which department would you like us to pilot next?” or “What tasks do you spend the most time on that could be assisted by AI?”
	•	Emphasise governance and data security to reassure senior management and staff (since AI raises questions).
	•	Make sure to cover the licensing/pricing (or at least that we are evaluating it) and where the tool fits in our existing Microsoft 365 footprint.
	•	After the session, provide a “cheat sheet” for each department with 3-5 suggested tasks to try in the next 30 days.
