Great question — yes, you **should** use Angular's built-in security tools to safely display markdown converted to HTML. Here's what you need to know:

---

## ✅ Why You Might See the Warning

Angular automatically **sanitizes HTML** in `[innerHTML]` to prevent XSS (cross-site scripting).
However, if you're rendering markdown that has been converted to HTML (via `marked.parse()`), Angular may strip out safe tags like `<h1>`, `<ul>`, `<strong>`, etc.

To render the full HTML safely, you can **explicitly trust** it using Angular's `DomSanitizer`.

## ✅ Updated `MarkdownPipe` Using `DomSanitizer`

Here’s the secure and recommended way to implement it:

```ts
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';
import { DomSanitizer, SafeHtml } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { marked } from 'marked';

@Pipe({ name: 'markdown' })
export class MarkdownPipe implements PipeTransform {
  constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {}

  transform(value: string): SafeHtml {
    const html = marked.parse(value || '');
    return this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(html);
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ This tells Angular: “I trust the HTML coming out of `marked`” — assuming you're **not injecting user-generated raw HTML** into `marked`, this is safe.

## ✅ Usage in Template

Keep this the same:

```html
<div class="markdown-output" *ngIf="commentaryResult" [innerHTML]="commentaryResult | markdown"></div>
```

## ✅ Summary

| Requirement              | Solution                                              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Keep markdown formatting | Use `marked.parse()` + `bypassSecurityTrustHtml()`    |
| Avoid XSS issues         | Only trust **sanitized, backend-controlled markdown** |
| Result                   | Clean, styled HTML rendering in your app              |

Let me know if you'd like CSS styles for headings, bold text, or lists inside `.markdown-output` to match your UI theme.
