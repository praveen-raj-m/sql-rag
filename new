Awesome—here’s a presentation-ready cheat sheet of prompting methods with crisp definitions and **detailed, work-grade examples** for six business domains: **Finance, Sales, IT, Risk & Compliance, HR, Legal.**
Copy/paste into slides as needed.

# 1) Zero-Shot Prompting

**Definition:** Ask for an outcome with no examples; rely on clear instructions, scope, and constraints.

**Finance:**
“Analyze the impact of a **+1% interest-rate increase** on our fixed-income portfolio (duration ~5.2, convexity ~0.18). If issuer-level data is missing, assume investment-grade, average spread +10 bps. Provide: (1) price impact estimate, (2) sectors most exposed, (3) 3 mitigation options.”

**Sales:**
“Draft a **2-paragraph value proposition** for our cloud analytics platform for mid-market retailers. Assume $50–$200M revenue, 10–15 store locations, legacy POS. Include 2 quantified benefits and 1 short customer quote (fabricated but realistic).”

**IT:**
“Propose a **rolling 30-day patch window** for Windows servers in prod/dev. Include risk tiers, CAB touchpoints, rollback steps, and KPI targets (patch latency, failure rate).”

**Risk & Compliance:**
“Prepare a **KRI dashboard outline** for third-party risk: define 5 KRIs, thresholds (green/amber/red), data sources, and escalation workflow.”

**HR:**
“Write a **2-page new-manager onboarding plan** for a 200-person engineering org covering week 1–4 goals, key stakeholders, and success metrics.”

**Legal:**
“Summarize **key clauses to negotiate** in a SaaS MSA (liability cap, data security, uptime SLA, IP ownership, audit rights). Give default positions and preferred alternatives.”

# 2) One-Shot Prompting

**Definition:** Provide **one example** to set format/style, then request the new output.

**Finance (Example → New Task):**
Example format: “**Finding:** X. **Evidence:** Y. **Impact:** Z. **Action:** A.”
“Using the format above, assess **currency risk** for our euro-denominated revenues (€40M; natural hedge 30%).”

**Sales:**
Example cold email (3 sentences, CTA link).

### Want this as a one-pager or slide deck?

I can turn this into a **clean, single-slide cheat sheet** or a **12–15 slide deck** (one method per slide with your logo/colors).




Great question 👍 — knowing *when* to use each prompting method is just as important as knowing *what* they are. Below is a **practical guide** you can share in your presentation, framed around real-world work scenarios.

---

# **When to Use Which Prompting Method**

### 1. **Zero-Shot Prompting**

* **When:** You need a quick, straightforward answer or draft with minimal setup.
* **Example Use:** HR leader asks Copilot: *“Summarize employee feedback from the last survey in 3 points.”*

---

### 2. **One-Shot Prompting**

* **When:** You want the model to follow a specific **style or format**.
* **Example Use:** Finance manager provides one example of risk memo, then asks: *“Write one for interest rate risk using the same format.”*

---

### 3. **Few-Shot Prompting**

* **When:** You need **consistency** across outputs, e.g., drafting multiple reports or case summaries.
* **Example Use:** Legal team feeds 2 clause summaries and asks Copilot to generate the third in the same structure.

---

### 4. **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**

* **When:** The task involves **reasoning, calculations, or multi-step analysis**.
* **Example Use:** Risk officer: *“Walk through step by step how a cyber breach in our vendor system would affect compliance reporting timelines.”*

---

### 5. **Role-Based Prompting**

* **When:** You need the answer framed as if coming from a **domain expert**.
* **Example Use:** IT director: *“As a security architect, recommend a cloud migration plan with focus on least privilege access.”*

---

### 6. **Iterative (Refinement) Prompting**

* **When:** You want to **evolve an idea** — from draft → refined → polished.
* **Example Use:** Sales lead: *“Draft a client pitch deck → now make it 5 slides shorter → now rewrite for C-suite audience.”*

---

### 7. **Instruction-Based Prompting**

* **When:** You want **control** over format, word count, or structure.
* **Example Use:** Compliance: *“Summarize GDPR obligations in exactly 5 bullets, each <12 words.”*

---

### 8. **Self-Consistency Prompting**

* **When:** There are **multiple possible solutions** and you want the best one.
* **Example Use:** HR: *“Suggest 3 hybrid work policies, compare pros/cons, and recommend one.”*

---

### 9. **Decomposition Prompting**

* **When:** The problem is **too big/complex** and needs to be broken into parts first.
* **Example Use:** Finance analyst: *“Break down ESG integration in investment analysis into sub-steps, then solve each.”*

---

### 10. **Retrieval / Context-Grounded Prompting**

* **When:** You have **reference material** (docs, contracts, datasets) and want answers **grounded only in that content**.
* **Example Use:** Legal: *“From this vendor contract, extract only data security clauses and list obligations.”*

---

✅ **Rule of Thumb:**

* **Simple → Zero/One-Shot**
* **Patterned → Few-Shot**
* **Complex Reasoning → Chain-of-Thought / Decomposition**
* **Specialist View → Role-Based**
* **Refinement Needed → Iterative**
* **Options Needed → Self-Consistency**
* **Strict Output → Instruction-Based**
* **Grounded in Docs → Retrieval**

Would you like me to turn this into a **decision flowchart (visual)** so in your presentation people can quickly see *“If task = X, then use Y prompt method”*? That works really well with large audiences.
