Totally agree—the system design matters more than the model when you’re limited to small local LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Gemma-3-12B). Here’s a design that keeps precision high, latency/cost low, and uses the LLM only where it’s safest.

The blueprint (LLM-light, precision-first)

0) Output contract (non-negotiable)

Lock this up front so everything downstream is auditable.

{
  "document_id": "string",
  "terms": [
    {
      "name": "Indemnified Party",
      "aliases": ["Indemnified Parties", "Indemnified Person"],
      "status": "found | missing | ambiguous | referenced_internal | referenced_external",
      "value": "VERBATIM TEXT",
      "evidence": {
        "page": 12,
        "section_header": "Definitions",
        "char_start": 5342,
        "char_end": 5678,
        "snippet": "…'Indemnified Party' means …"
      },
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": ""
    }
  ]
}

Rules: value must be verbatim; include location evidence; allow abstaining.

⸻

1) Candidate generation (deterministic, high recall)

No LLM here.
	•	Aliases & morphology: Precompute plural/singular, hyphenation, quotes, capitalization. Use a trie (Aho-Corasick) to scan quickly.
	•	Core patterns (regex):
	•	(?i)\b"?(TERM|ALIAS)"?\s+(means|shall mean|is defined as)\b
	•	(?i)\bhas the meaning (set forth|given) (in|under|at)\b
	•	(?i)\bas used herein, "?(TERM|ALIAS)"?\b
	•	Section bias: detect “Definitions”, “Interpretation”, “Certain Definitions” headers and list structures (a., b., i., ii., bullets, em-dashes).
	•	Span capture: from match → extend to first terminating delimiter (.; or next bullet). Keep (page, header, char offsets, text, snippet).

Output: for each of your 20 terms, 0-N candidates with rich metadata.

⸻

2) Ranking (hybrid retrieval, still no LLM)

You want robustness without heavy compute:
	•	Keyword/BM25: Score by query "TERM" + aliases + ("means" OR "shall mean") vs candidate text.
	•	Definition cue bonus: +w if inside a Definitions section, contains means/shall mean, starts with quoted headword.
	•	Cross-ref penalty: −w if has the meaning set forth and the referenced section isn’t resolved yet.
	•	Light embeddings (optional): If you have a small local model (e.g., bge-small, all-MiniLM), compute cosine between a fixed query like Definition of "<TERM>" in a contract and candidate text. Keep it secondary to keywords/patterns.

Score example
final = 0.55*BM25 + 0.3*pattern_bonus + 0.15*cosine

Keep top 1–3 per term for the next step.

⸻

3) Cross-reference resolver (deterministic)

If best candidate is “has the meaning set forth in Section X”:
	•	Jump to Section X by your section index and re-run Step 2 within that section.
	•	If it points to another document (e.g., UCC, “this Policy”), set status: referenced_external; store the citation; do not invent the text.

⸻

4) LLM only as a validator/normalizer (tiny prompt)

With small local models, keep prompts micro and fully constrained:
	•	Inputs to LLM (per term):
	•	The term name + aliases.
	•	Top K candidate snippets (K ≤ 3, each ≤ 500–800 chars).
	•	Exact JSON schema (short) + hard rules.
	•	LLM task:
	•	Choose the best candidate or mark missing.
	•	Return exact JSON. value must be a substring of evidence.snippet. No rewriting.
	•	Prefer explicit means/shall mean over cross-refs. If only cross-ref is available and resolvable (Step 3), use resolved text; else referenced_external.
	•	If two conflicting locals exist → ambiguous (put the longer/clearer in value; note the other in notes).

Grammar-constrained decoding
Use JSON enforcement (e.g., lm-format-enforcer/Outlines/Guidance) so the 8B/12B model cannot drift.

Guardrail after LLM
Programmatically verify value ∈ snippet. If not, downgrade to ambiguous or missing.

⸻

5) Confidence you can trust (no magic)

Combine rules, not model vibes:
	•	Base: +0.6 if in Definitions; +0.2 if contains means/shall mean; +0.1 if headword quoted; −0.3 if cross-ref unresolved; −0.2 if multiple conflicting locals.
	•	Clamp to [0,1]. This number should be explainable.

⸻

6) Chunking & parsing choices (optimize for small models)
	•	Parsing: pdfminer/pypdf. If scanned, OCR page-by-page (Tesseract). Always keep page boundaries + char offsets.
	•	Index: sentences (or short spans) with (page, header). No need for a full vector DB—just arrays and BM25 over the sentence list.
	•	Token budget: never send whole pages; send only the candidate spans. Aim for <1k tokens per term (often <300).

⸻

7) Error classes you’ll actually see
	•	Duplicate local definitions → ambiguous with both locations listed.
	•	Forward references → resolve once, cache result.
	•	Terms defined by incorporation (UCC/GDPR) → referenced_external with citation.
	•	Capitalized but undefined terms → missing + note first occurrence page.

⸻

8) Evaluation loop (for legal-grade precision)
	•	Create a gold set (5–10 contracts) with human-verified JSON.
	•	Track precision@1 (exact match), recall (found vs expected), abstain rate (missing when present).
	•	Add unit tests for each regex/pattern and cross-ref resolver.
	•	Regression test on every rule tweak.

⸻

9) Prompts for small local models (copy/paste)

System (once):

You are a compliance extraction engine. Output ONLY valid JSON matching the provided schema. 
Do not paraphrase legal text. If a definition cannot be copied verbatim from the provided snippet, mark status as "missing".

Per-term user prompt (≤ 500–900 tokens total):

Task: Pick the best definition of the target term OR return "missing". 
Rules:
- value MUST be a verbatim substring of evidence.snippet.
- Prefer definitions with "means"/"shall mean" within a Definitions section.
- If only a cross-reference exists and cannot be resolved from the provided candidates, use status "referenced_external".
- If two distinct local definitions conflict, use status "ambiguous" and put the clearer/longer in value; note the other in notes.
- Return only JSON matching this schema: { ...schema here, minimized ... }

Target:
- name: "<TERM>"
- aliases: ["A1", "A2"]

Candidates (top to bottom are strongest):
1) meta: page=<p>, header="<h>", char=[s,e]
snippet:
<<<SNIPPET TEXT>>>
2) ...

(Keep schema minimal in the prompt; you verify/augment fields post-hoc.)

⸻

10) Implementation order (so you see wins early)
	1.	Parser + page/offset tracking.
	2.	Term config (terms.yaml with aliases & edge-case rules).
	3.	Deterministic candidate finder (regex + Aho-Corasick).
	4.	Ranker (BM25 + pattern bonuses; optional tiny embeddings).
	5.	Cross-ref resolver (intra-doc only, then mark external).
	6.	LLM validator with JSON enforcement (tiny prompts).
	7.	Post-validator (substring check, evidence sanity).
	8.	Confidence calculator (rule-based).
	9.	Regression tests + gold set.

⸻

11) When to skip the LLM entirely

If you get a candidate that is:
	•	in a Definitions section,
	•	contains means/shall mean,
	•	headword matches the target (or alias) exactly, and
	•	no cross-ref language,

…you can auto-accept without calling the LLM. This saves tokens and is often the majority case.

⸻

12) Storage & ops
	•	Keep a document cache: text, section map, and candidate list (so re-runs are cheap).
	•	Version the output JSON with a hash of the source file.
	•	Log a provenance trail (scores, rules fired) for auditor review.

⸻

TL;DR
	•	Rules to find, BM25 (+tiny embeddings) to rank, small LLM only to validate into JSON with grammar constraints.
	•	Always return verbatim text with evidence.
	•	Prefer abstaining (missing) over guessing.
	•	Build confidence from transparent, deterministic signals.

If you’d like, share a redacted sample and your 20 terms/aliases—I’ll tailor the regex set, cross-ref resolver, and a minimal JSON-enforced prompt that fits in an 8B model’s comfort zone.




Short answer: use a hybrid pipeline—deterministic rules to find candidates, embeddings to rank them, and an LLM only to normalize & validate the final text into your JSON schema (with evidence). Don’t rely on cosine similarity or an LLM alone for legal docs where precision matters.

Here’s a battle-tested pattern that works well for “20 terms + definitions”:

1) Define the contract for outputs (JSON schema)

Give the model (and your evaluators) a single truth format. Include an “evidence” field with location so you can audit.

{
  "document_id": "string",
  "terms": [
    {
      "name": "Indemnified Party",
      "aliases": ["Indemnified Parties", "Indemnified Person"],
      "status": "found | missing | ambiguous",
      "value": "verbatim definition text",
      "evidence": {
        "page": 12,
        "section_header": "Definitions",
        "char_start": 5342,
        "char_end": 5678,
        "snippet": "…“Indemnified Party” means…"
      },
      "confidence": 0.0,
      "notes": "if ambiguous or synthesized info about resolution"
    }
  ]
}

Key points:
	•	Verbatim text only in value (no paraphrase).
	•	Include aliases (synonyms/plurals) for recall.
	•	status lets you safely “abstain”.
	•	evidence offsets (or at least page/line) make it auditable.
	•	A numeric confidence helps triage manual review.

2) Candidate generation (deterministic & high-recall)

Scan the doc for definition patterns and index them.
	•	Heuristics/regex:
	•	(?i)\b"?(TERM|ALIAS)"?\s+(means|shall mean|is defined as)\b
	•	(?i)\bDefinitions?\b section parsing (bulleted/lettered lists).
	•	Cross-reference captures: has the meaning set forth in Section ….
	•	Structural signals:
	•	Bold/SmallCaps/Quoted terms in PDFs/Word.
	•	Colon/semicolon breaks commonly used in definition lists.
	•	Lexical fallback:
	•	Headword detection near means/shall mean.
	•	Nearby sentence windows (e.g., 2–3 sentences).
	•	Negative & cross-doc traps:
	•	Watch has the meaning given in the UCC → mark as referenced not locally defined.
	•	If a term is defined twice → mark ambiguous and keep both candidates for the resolver.

Store each candidate with: term guess, text span, page, header, and a quick BM25 score against the target term + aliases.

3) Rank candidates (scoring & retrieval)

Use hybrid retrieval so you aren’t dependent on cosine alone:
	•	BM25 / keyword score on: term + aliases + ("means" OR "shall mean").
	•	Embedding similarity (e.g., sentence-transformers) between:
	•	Query: a small, canonical “definition intent” prompt for that term (e.g., “Definition of ‘Indemnified Party’ in a contract”).
	•	Candidate span text.
	•	Optional pattern bonus if the span contains means/shall mean or is inside a “Definitions” section.

Compute a final score like:

final = 0.5 * BM25 + 0.4 * cosine + 0.1 * pattern_bonus

Keep top N (often N=3) per term for the next step.

4) LLM as a constrained validator/normalizer, not a discoverer

Feed only the top N candidate spans for each term to an LLM with a strict system prompt:
	•	Instruct:
	•	“Return exactly one JSON object per the schema.”
	•	“Choose the best candidate or return status: "missing".”
	•	“value must be a verbatim substring from evidence.snippet; if not present, mark missing—do not paraphrase.”
	•	“Prefer definitions that include ‘means/shall mean’ over cross-references.”
	•	“If two distinct definitions exist, set status: "ambiguous" and include the longer/more explicit one in value, and add the other to notes with its location.”
	•	Provide the target term, alias list, and the candidate snippets + metadata.
	•	Ask the model to set confidence (e.g., 0–1) following rules (presence of “means”, within “Definitions” section, no cross-reference, etc.). You can also compute confidence deterministically on your side and have the LLM only decide status.

This keeps hallucination risk low and makes outputs consistent.

5) Handle cross-references

If the candidate says “has the meaning set forth in Section 1.1”:
	•	Resolve the referenced section with your index and re-run ranking on that section.
	•	If it points to another document (e.g., “as defined in the UCC”), mark status: "referenced_external"; optionally store the citation.

6) Chunking & windows (for PDFs)
	•	Parse to text with page boundaries (pdfminer, Tesseract OCR if scanned).
	•	Create an index of:
	•	Sections/headers (TOC, headings).
	•	Sentences with page numbers & character offsets.
	•	Build windows of ~800–1500 chars around candidate hits for the LLM step to reduce token cost.

7) Quality controls (legal-grade precision)
	•	Abstain: Prefer missing over guessing.
	•	Verbatim match: Validate value is a substring of the evidence before accepting the LLM output.
	•	Dedup: If the exact same string shows up multiple times, choose the one in “Definitions”.
	•	Normalization (non-destructive): Strip leading/trailing quotes and punctuation; never rewrite internal wording.
	•	Unit tests: Maintain a gold set of 5–10 contracts with expected JSON to regression-test your pipeline.
	•	Inter-annotator checks if you have human reviewers.

8) Minimal tech stack (Python)
	•	Parsing: pdfminer.six / pypdf (+ pytesseract for scans).
	•	Sectioning: simple header regex or unstructured library.
	•	Search: rank_bm25.
	•	Embeddings: sentence-transformers (e.g., all-mpnet-base-v2) for local; or any hosted embedding.
	•	Fuzzy term matching: rapidfuzz.
	•	LLM (optional but recommended for validation): any provider that supports structured output (JSON schema) or function-calling. Keep prompts small by passing only top candidates.

9) Example control flow (pseudo)

terms = [
  {"name": "Indemnified Party", "aliases": ["Indemnified Parties", "Indemnified Person"]},
  # ... 19 more
]

doc = parse_pdf_with_pages("agreement.pdf")
index = build_sentence_index(doc)  # sentences with page, offsets, section headers

candidates = []
for t in terms:
    hits = rule_based_hits(index, t)          # regex around "means/shall mean"
    hits += lexical_hits(index, t)            # header list bullets, quotes, capitalization
    scored = score_candidates(hits, t)        # BM25 + cosine + pattern bonus
    topk = top_k(scored, k=3)
    candidates.append({"term": t, "topk": topk})

# LLM validate/normalize per term
outputs = []
for item in candidates:
    j = llm_validate_normalize(item["term"], item["topk"], schema=json_schema)
    outputs.append(post_validate(j, doc_text))  # ensure value is verbatim substring, fix offsets

final_json = {"document_id": "agreement-2025-09-22", "terms": outputs}

10) Why this beats “LLM only” or “cosine only”
	•	LLM only risks hallucination and inconsistent granularity (and can paraphrase legal language).
	•	Cosine only can miss exact definitions, over-match recitals, and fail in edge phrasing.
	•	Hybrid gives:
	•	High recall from rules/aliases.
	•	Robust ranking from BM25+embeddings.
	•	High precision & consistent formatting from a constrained LLM that can also adjudicate ties and set statuses.

11) Practical tips
	•	Alias lists matter: pluralization, hyphenation, US/UK variants, internal shorthand (e.g., “Company”, “the Company”, “Corporation”).
	•	Stop at “means”: If a definition runs multiple sentences, capture until the first hard delimiter (semicolon/period) unless bullets continue the same definition.
	•	Two-pass run: Pass 1 on “Definitions” section; Pass 2 on the rest of the document for cross-references and missed items.
	•	Confidence thresholds: e.g., auto-accept if (in Definitions section) + contains “means/shall mean” + no cross-reference; else flag for review.
	•	Versioning: Save the exact source pages for traceability.

⸻

If you want, I can draft a small Python starter that:
	•	parses a PDF,
	•	finds “TERM … means …” patterns for your 20 terms + aliases,
	•	ranks with BM25+embeddings,
	•	and emits the JSON in the schema above (LLM step optional/toggle).
