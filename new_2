| **Misalignment**                   | When AI’s output diverges from user intent or organizational values.                              | Copilot generating creative but off-policy recommendations.     |
| **Context Loss**                   | When an AI forgets prior parts of a conversation or document due to token limits.                 | Copilot omitting earlier sections in a long report.             |
| **Overconfidence**                 | When AI expresses uncertainty as certainty, misleading the user.                                  | AI confidently giving a wrong legal interpretation.             |
| **Data Poisoning**                 | Malicious alteration of training data to corrupt model behavior.                                  | Injecting fake financial data during model training.            |
| **Information Contamination**      | When AI responses mix internal and external data incorrectly.                                     | Model combining client data with public web info.               |
| **Ethical Drift**                  | Gradual deviation of AI behavior from ethical norms due to unmonitored learning or updates.       | AI making profit-optimizing suggestions that breach compliance. |
| **Automation Bias**                | Human tendency to trust AI output without verification.                                           | Accepting AI-generated analysis without reviewing data.         |
| **Opaque Reasoning ("Black Box")** | Difficulty in understanding how AI arrived at its answer.                                         | LLM gives result without explaining its logic.                  |
| **Dependency Risk**                | Overreliance on AI leading to skill degradation or operational gaps.                              | Team losing manual auditing ability due to full automation.     |
| **Compliance Risk**                | Violation of data, legal, or regulatory frameworks due to AI misuse.                              | AI sharing data that breaches GDPR or HIPAA.                    |
| **Accountability Gap**             | Unclear responsibility for AI-generated outcomes or errors.                                       | Who’s liable when AI suggests incorrect legal advice?           |

Would you like me to follow this up with a **“Risk Mitigation & Control Measures”** table — showing how to manage each of these risks (e.g., *Hallucination → use retrieval grounding; Bias → audit datasets; Prompt Injection → apply guardrails*)? It pairs perfectly with this section for your presentation.


Would you like me to format this as a **polished 3-page PDF appendix** titled

> “AI, Copilot & Generative Intelligence Glossary — Business Edition (2025)”
> with section icons, visual separators, and color-coded headings (ideal for a professional presentation or firm handbook)?
