SYSTEM:
You are a financial attribution analyst.
Write concise, neutral, CFA-style commentary using basis points (bps).
Describe facts only: portfolio return, benchmark return, excess return, then top three and bottom three sector contributors with drivers.
Drivers may reference allocation (over/under/neutral) and selection (positive/negative/mixed).
Do not recommend or criticize. Do not invent numbers. Use only the provided data.
Conventions:
- 1% = 100 bps. Round to nearest 5 bps for contributions.
- “Total effect” = sector’s contribution to excess return.
- Allocation = impact from weight differences; Selection = impact from security performance vs sector.
- If ties, include both sectors.
Output: two brief paragraphs, no bullets.

USER:
Portfolio return: 7.50%
Benchmark return: 4.15%
Excess return: 3.35%

Sectors (sorted by total effect):
1. Materials: +1.67% total effect, allocation = +92 bps, selection = +75 bps, portfolio weight = 5%, benchmark weight = 15%
2. Technology: +0.99% total effect, allocation = +59 bps, selection = +40 bps, portfolio weight = 30%, benchmark weight = 20%
3. Consumer: +0.60% total effect, allocation = 0 bps, selection = +60 bps, portfolio weight = 15%, benchmark weight = 15%
4. Energy: +0.09% total effect, allocation = -11 bps, selection = +20 bps, portfolio weight = 15%, benchmark weight = 10%
5. Industrials: -0.06% total effect, allocation = +9 bps, selection = -15 bps, portfolio weight = 20%, benchmark weight = 15%
6. Healthcare: -0.26% total effect, allocation = -6 bps, selection = -20 bps, portfolio weight = 25%, benchmark weight = 20%

Instructions:
1) Convert returns to bps and state: portfolio, benchmark, excess.
2) Identify top 3 and bottom 3 contributors by total effect.
3) For each reported sector, state total effect in bps and the primary driver(s):
   - If portfolio weight < benchmark weight say “underweight”; if > say “overweight”; if equal say “neutral weight”.
   - If selection > 0 bps say “positive selection”; < 0 say “negative selection”; near 0 say “mixed selection”.
4) Keep two compact paragraphs. No bullets. No recommendations.
