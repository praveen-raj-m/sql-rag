| **Drift (Model Drift)**            | When model performance declines over time due to changing data or environments.                   | Financial risk model failing after new regulations.             |
| **Adversarial Attack**             | Intentionally crafted inputs that trick AI systems into incorrect behavior.                       | Slightly altered invoice text bypassing fraud detection.        |
| **Toxic Output**                   | Offensive, biased, or inappropriate content generated by an AI model.                             | AI assistant producing discriminatory or unsafe language.       |
| **Misalignment**                   | When AI‚Äôs output diverges from user intent or organizational values.                              | Copilot generating creative but off-policy recommendations.     |
| **Context Loss**                   | When an AI forgets prior parts of a conversation or document due to token limits.                 | Copilot omitting earlier sections in a long report.             |
| **Overconfidence**                 | When AI expresses uncertainty as certainty, misleading the user.                                  | AI confidently giving a wrong legal interpretation.             |
| **Data Poisoning**                 | Malicious alteration of training data to corrupt model behavior.                                  | Injecting fake financial data during model training.            |
| **Information Contamination**      | When AI responses mix internal and external data incorrectly.                                     | Model combining client data with public web info.               |
| **Ethical Drift**                  | Gradual deviation of AI behavior from ethical norms due to unmonitored learning or updates.       | AI making profit-optimizing suggestions that breach compliance. |
| **Automation Bias**                | Human tendency to trust AI output without verification.                                           | Accepting AI-generated analysis without reviewing data.         |
| **Opaque Reasoning ("Black Box")** | Difficulty in understanding how AI arrived at its answer.                                         | LLM gives result without explaining its logic.                  |
| **Dependency Risk**                | Overreliance on AI leading to skill degradation or operational gaps.                              | Team losing manual auditing ability due to full automation.     |
| **Compliance Risk**                | Violation of data, legal, or regulatory frameworks due to AI misuse.                              | AI sharing data that breaches GDPR or HIPAA.                    |
| **Accountability Gap**             | Unclear responsibility for AI-generated outcomes or errors.                                       | Who‚Äôs liable when AI suggests incorrect legal advice?           |

Would you like me to follow this up with a **‚ÄúRisk Mitigation & Control Measures‚Äù** table ‚Äî showing how to manage each of these risks (e.g., *Hallucination ‚Üí use retrieval grounding; Bias ‚Üí audit datasets; Prompt Injection ‚Üí apply guardrails*)? It pairs perfectly with this section for your presentation.


Would you like me to format this as a **polished 3-page PDF appendix** titled

> ‚ÄúAI, Copilot & Generative Intelligence Glossary ‚Äî Business Edition (2025)‚Äù
> with section icons, visual separators, and color-coded headings (ideal for a professional presentation or firm handbook)?
